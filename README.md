## Testing Strategies

### Accessibility Testing
Accessibility testing ensures that your software is usable by people with disabilities. This includes checking compatibility with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.

#### Tools
- **axe-core**: A JavaScript library for accessibility testing.
- **WAVE**: A web accessibility evaluation tool.

### Automated Testing
Automated testing helps you run tests quickly and efficiently. This approach reduces human error and saves time.

#### Tools
- **Selenium**: A widely used framework for web application testing.
- **Cypress**: A fast, easy-to-use testing framework for web applications.

### Performance Testing
Performance testing evaluates how your application performs under various conditions. This includes load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing.

#### Tools
- **JMeter**: An open-source tool for performance testing.
- **LoadRunner**: A performance testing tool from Micro Focus.

### Visual Regression Testing
Visual regression testing checks for unintended changes in the UI. This is crucial to maintain a consistent user experience.

#### Tools
- **BackstopJS**: A visual regression testing tool for web applications.
- **Percy**: A visual testing tool that integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

## QA Methodologies

### Best Practices
- **Test Early and Often**: Integrate testing into your development process.
- **Use Version Control**: Keep track of changes in your test scripts.
- **Document Tests**: Maintain clear documentation for all tests.

### Continuous Testing
Continuous testing involves running automated tests throughout the development lifecycle. This ensures that issues are identified and addressed quickly.

#### Tools
- **Jenkins**: A popular CI/CD tool that supports continuous testing.
- **CircleCI**: A cloud-based CI/CD tool that automates testing.
